# Portfolio.py for Fintual homework
A Portfolio class that has a Profit method which takes two dates and returns the profit made between those.

To run the script you just have to run this in the console:
```
python3 main.py date_start date_end
```
Where date_start is just the oldest date, while date_end the newest, being both in 'day-mont-year' format.
